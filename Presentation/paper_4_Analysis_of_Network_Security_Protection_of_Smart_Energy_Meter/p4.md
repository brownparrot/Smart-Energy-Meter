## 1. Metering Module

**Purpose:**  
This module is responsible for the core function of the smart energy meter â€” measuring the electrical consumption.

**Components:**  
- **Metering Chip**: Captures real-time electricity data such as energy usage, voltage, and current. It can handle advanced functions like harmonic energy metering and minute freezing.  
- **Power Module**: Converts the 220V AC supply to DC power for the meter's operation.  

--- 
- **Battery**: The meter uses a replaceable battery to ensure continuous operation.

**Communication:**  
The metering module communicates with the management module via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).

**Key Function:**  
Accurate energy measurement and data collection for further processing and analysis.

## 2. Management Module

**Purpose:**  
This module manages the data from the metering module, controls the operations of the meter, and facilitates communication with external systems.
**Components:**  
- **Management Chip**: Handles intelligent functions like temperature measurement, software upgrades, intelligent display, and reporting of operational data.  
- **Power Conversion Module**: Provides DC power to the management chip.

---
**Communication:**  
- The management module communicates externally through Bluetooth with devices like mobile phones, handheld devices, concentrators, or external sensors.  
- It also connects to the expansion module via UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter).

**Key Function:**  
Provides security features (e.g., encryption, authentication) and user interfaces, while also handling the control and monitoring functions.
